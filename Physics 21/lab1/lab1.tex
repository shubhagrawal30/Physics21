\subsection*{Introduction}
We attempt to obtain time-dependent intensity data for the variable system Her X-1 from the Catalina (CTRS) Surveys. Two methods were used, which are described under the two separate sections below. The first involves scarping the webpage in \textit{.html} format and using string manipulations to generate two lists and plot them. The second involves downloading the data in \textit{VOTable} format, and attempting to obtain the same plot as under (taken from the CRTS website). Source code is available in the file \textit{lab1.py}, while the VOTable \textit{.xml} file is attached as Appendix at the end of this document.

\subsection*{Part 1: HTML format}
HTML data for the system Her X-1, from the photcal survey in short form, was obtained from \textit{http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/getcssconedbid\_release2.cgi}. The file was decoded to text, and string manipulations were used to get the below plot.

	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{html.png}
	\label{html}
	\caption{Magnitude versus Time (in mean Julian days) plot, obtained using the \textit{getValues()} function.}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Part 2: VOTable format}
VOTable data for the system Her X-1, from the photcal survey in short form, was obtained from \textit{http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/DataRelease/upload/result\_web\_fileyUkAfF.vot}. The file was saved as .xml, and array manipulations were used to get the below plot.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{vot.png}
	\label{vot}
	\caption{Magnitude versus Time (in mean Julian days) plot, obtained using the \textit{getVOTvalues()} function.}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{Result}
The two graphs obtained from the scarped data are similar to the plot given on the CRTS site.
